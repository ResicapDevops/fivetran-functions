# Fivetran

[Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/) helps you centralize data from disparate sources into your data storage platform that you can manage directly from your browser. Fivetranâ€™s fully automated connectors extract your data from cloud applications, databases, event logs, and more, and load it into your preferred data storage platform.

## Getting Started

[Create you Fivetran account](https://fivetran.com/signup?email=) and get started.

## Cloud Function Connectors

[Functions connectors](https://fivetran.com/docs/functions) allows you to code a custom data connector as an extension of Fivetran. If you have a custom data source or a private API that we don't support, you can develop a serverless ELT data pipeline using our Function connectors.

## Supported Platforms

Fivetran supports the following cloud functions platforms:

 - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
 - [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/Functions/Serverless)
 - [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) 

## Sample Functions

The GitHub repo contains sample functions you can use to build your own cloud functions. We have included sample functions to fetch data from the following data sources:

- [Elastic search server](https://github.com/fivetran/functions/tree/master/elastic_search)
- [Databases](https://github.com/fivetran/functions/tree/master/database)
